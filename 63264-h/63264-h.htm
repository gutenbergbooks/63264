<p>Not skinniness! It&rsquo;s no light
matter, Hortense, this question
of figures. You can <i>figure</i> on that.
Even the new styles won&rsquo;t hide
the awful fact that you bulge
where you shouldn&rsquo;t, OR that you
own <i>no</i> curves where you should.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a tough racket melting the too,
too solid flesh. Figure how much you have
crept up on the scale, let your doctor
figure how fast you dare go down without
landing&mdash;flop&mdash;farther than you ever intended.
This little book? It&rsquo;s encouragement,
blandishment, a little judicious
enragement&mdash;but it isn&rsquo;t medicament.</p>
<p>How about reducing tricks? Well,
Dumpling, let&rsquo;s take a look. Glands? A
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
slick trick for a few, probably not you.
Bath salts? They dissolve the budget,
nothing more. Laxatives? Money in the
promoter&rsquo;s pocket. Thyroid and other
drugs? No, no, NO!</p>
<p>Suppose you want to go up the scale?
Put some curves in place of angles? Improve
the pep and disposition? Reverse
what the fat gal does. Where she envies,
you eat. Where she hustles, you rest.
When she refuses a snack, you snatch it.</p>
<p>Either way you go on the scale&mdash;up or
down&mdash;it comes back largely to how much
you eat, when, and most important, <i>what</i>.
Either way you go, don&rsquo;t neglect&mdash;milk,
cheese, eggs, meat, and fish&mdash;fruits, vegetables,
and whole-grain cereals. Emphasize
salt and water to gain, cut down on
both to lose.</p>
<p>Cheerio, whichever way you&rsquo;re bound.
The diet does it. You can figure on that,
lady!</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="300" height="186" />
</div>
<p>There comes a day in many a woman&rsquo;s
life when she has a THOUGHT. Namely:
&ldquo;I MUST start on a diet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mere trifle may bring on this thought.
Such as:</p>
<p>a) a saleswoman murmurs, &ldquo;Well,
dear, perhaps a size 38 <i>would</i> be just a
wee bit more comfy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>b) a taxi driver asks, &ldquo;Where to,
Madam?&rdquo; (they&rsquo;ve always called you
&ldquo;Miss&rdquo;).</p>
<p>c) a husbandly voice commands, &ldquo;Sit
in front with me, Sonnie, and give
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
mother the back seat where she can
spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>d) walking down Main Street you
catch a quick, dreadfully candid glimpse
of yourself in a plate glass window.
&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the THOUGHT has come to you,
it is likely, alas, to be followed swiftly
by second, third, fourth, and fifth
thoughts. Thus:</p>
<p>2) &ldquo;Oh well, I&rsquo;m not so <i>very</i> fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3) &ldquo;As it is, I don&rsquo;t eat enough to keep
a bird alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4) &ldquo;Anyhow, I come by it naturally&mdash;look
at my own mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>5) &ldquo;Besides, diets are dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t argue with you about
thoughts 2, 3 or 4, assuming that you
know more about your weight, your
intake, and your mother than we do.
But when you get to thought 5, we rise
up, thus:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 id="c4">DIETS NEED NOT BE DREADFUL</h3>
<p>(If this booklet doesn&rsquo;t prove it, then
you go right on eating food and we&rsquo;ll
have to eat the booklet.)</p>
<h3 id="c5">DON&rsquo;T FALL FOR FALLACIES!</h3>
<p>You can easily talk yourself out of
dieting by falling for one of those old
fallacies that women hug to their (ample)
bosoms, namely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I <i>really</i> need is a new girdle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="125" height="269" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;To be slim and svelte, all you need
to do is to ooze yourself into our
Streamliner Stretch.&rdquo; Sez the ad.
&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; sez we. Common courtesy
should tell you
that you have to
meet a two-way
stretch half-way.
No sixteen-ounce
trifle of satin
and elastic is
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
going to cope with 160 pounds of womanhood,
and stay svelte. Science is
wonderful, my dear, but it&rsquo;s not <i>that</i>
good!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really need my extra weight for
reserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We freely admit that camels are
said to store up extra fat for reserve
in their humps. Camels lead hard
lives. But when were <i>you</i> last in the
Sahara Desert?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the will power to go on
a reducing diet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t <i>will</i> power so much as <i>choice</i>
power that&rsquo;s needed. We complimented
a girl recently for sticking so faithfully
to a diet. &ldquo;Honestly, it isn&rsquo;t a bit
hard now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I simply looked
myself in the eye one day and asked,
&lsquo;Well, which do you choose&mdash;to step
into a nifty 36 without alterations?
Or fudge cake?&rsquo; After I really set my
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
mind on the 36, the fudge cake just
bored me.&rdquo; (There must be a moral here
somewhere.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;ll start on a diet ...
next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All we can say to this is that statistics
(and human nature) prove that you
won&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="c6">THE CASE OF MRS. PLENTEOUS</h3>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve been appealing to your
good looks. Here goes for a try at your
good sense. (You must have some, or
you wouldn&rsquo;t still be reading.) We refer
to good sense about health.</p>
<p>Some women are beautiful, some are
healthy, some are
both, and some are
neither. And into
the last class fall
(or roll) the definitely
overweight.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="153" height="150" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re going to cry, &ldquo;Nonsense!
Look at Mrs. Plenteous; she&rsquo;s enormous,
and as healthy as a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know Mrs. Plenteous
personally, but we&rsquo;ll take your word
that she&rsquo;s a human being, and as such
she was never intended to be enormous.
She was made according to a careful
pattern that hasn&rsquo;t varied in thousands
of years, by an expert designer who
put strength and usefulness and beauty
into his designs. Mrs. Plenteous has
the regulation number of bones, muscles,
and vital organs (barring operations).
None of them is enormous. Each was
built to carry around a certain weight
without undue strain. If Mrs. Plenteous
is enormous, her organs are carrying
around an enormous strain. They <i>can</i>
take it&mdash;for a while&mdash;and they <i>will</i>&mdash;for
a while. But Mrs. Plenteous is not
really healthy, she&rsquo;s just lucky&mdash;so far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c7">DON&rsquo;T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT</h3>
<p>Ask your doctor. Ask your insurance
agent (if you can edge in a word). They
will tell you, we think, that excessive
waistlines tend to go along with shorter
lifelines. Medical records warn us that
the overweight (or underweight, see page
21) person is much more susceptible to
illness than the person whose weight is
normal. And how surgeons loathe operating
through layers of fat! And by the way,
look around you at a roomful of elderly
people. Aren&rsquo;t most of them rather willowy?
The &ldquo;enormous&rdquo; ones left early.</p>
<h3 id="c8">SAFETY FIRST!</h3>
<p>There are so many tricky health questions
involved in reducing that we are
not going to take the responsibility of
advising you specifically how to do it.
We do suggest, however, that you:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p><b>1) See your doctor.</b> If you haven&rsquo;t
a doctor of your own, see somebody
else&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;ll be glad to become yours
for the asking. He knows much more
about you than you do, having spent a
great deal of time and money to learn
it, which you never did. Perhaps an
ordinary reducing diet is not for you.
Perhaps you have funny glands or a
messy metabolism, which he will discover
by careful tests and experiments.
Perhaps you are not as overweight as
you think you are.</p>
<p><b>2) Do what your doctor tells you.</b>
This will surprise him very much, but
will also please
and flatter him,
and will cause him
to work like mad
on your case.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="100" height="136" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p><b>3) Don&rsquo;t take any advice from
your friends.</b> You know very well that
you don&rsquo;t agree with their politics,
approve of their hats, or care much for
their children. Why should you trust
them on a matter much more intimate
and vital?</p>
<p><b>4) Don&rsquo;t try short cuts.</b> It took
time to put on those extra pounds,
and it will take time to get them off.
Don&rsquo;t be beguiled by success stories of
fad diets or slimming salts. You want
to reduce your weight <i>only</i>&mdash;not your
chances of life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness. These magic potions may
be harmless in
nine cases out of
ten, but it&rsquo;s maybe
just <i>your</i> luck
to draw number
ten!</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="143" height="130" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h3 id="c9">WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE, GIRLS?</h3>
<p>... into the pantry! To hear us talk
about diets you might be thinking that
we disapprove of food in general. Not
so; we love it! Both kinds, the Protective
Foods and the Energy Foods.</p>
<h3 id="c10">LIVE&mdash;AND ENJOY LIFE</h3>
<p>The Protective Foods keep you alive.
The Energy Foods keep you enjoying
life. Energy foods are like the gas in
your car; they give you the quick start,
the power to go places, the speed to
get there fast. If you&rsquo;ve ever run out of
gas on a country road, you know how
important energy is.</p>
<p>Energy foods are delicious. And
fattening. Let&rsquo;s boldly mention a few:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chocolate eclairs, pies, French pastries,
griddle cakes, shortcake, rich
salad dressings&mdash;yummy!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>If you would reduce yourself, reduce
them first! Of course, there are other
Energy Foods without so much glamor
but with more honest goodness (and
less fat). We refer to such friends of
humanity as bread and potatoes. Don&rsquo;t
see too much of them, but don&rsquo;t snub
them entirely. And whenever you reduce
<i>any</i> of the Energy Foods, be sure to
put in their places more of the Protective
Foods.</p>
<p>For the Protective Foods are like the
brakes on your car. They keep you
out of trouble. They build up your
blood by bringing it minerals and
vitamins. They help you repel colds
and other worse things (if there <i>are</i>
any worse things).</p>
<p>We can conceal from you no longer
the fact that these good, reliable, tasty
and health building foods include:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h3 id="c11">MILK&mdash;VEGETABLES&mdash;FRUITS&mdash;EGGS&mdash;MEAT&mdash;CHEESE</h3>
<p>Whatever you weigh, you need both
kinds of food. So don&rsquo;t go cutting out all
energy foods and then, when you get to
feeling droopy, say we told you to do it.
WE NEVER DID.</p>
<h3 id="c12">DID SOMEBODY SAY &ldquo;MILK&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>At this point some pupil is sure to raise
her hand and ask, &ldquo;Oh, but isn&rsquo;t milk
<i>terribly</i> fattening?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="106" height="150" />
</div>
<p>No, Gwendolyn, it isn&rsquo;t. Milk gets
its chief fame from calcium. Calcium
may sound like a pretty dull mineral,
but believe us, it&rsquo;s worth its weight in
gold. In fact, if
you have plenty of
calcium in your
teeth, you won&rsquo;t
need so much gold.
As for bones, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
are full of calcium, or should be. Milk
also contains several vitamins and a
dozen or so other minerals. In fact, milk
is a mineral mine (and yours, too, since
there&rsquo;s plenty for both of us).</p>
<p>Moreover, milk is rich in proteins.
And proteins are the material from
which your muscles are made. If you
have no muscles to speak of, please
consider that we are speaking of your
husband&rsquo;s muscles. (If <i>he</i> has none, we
have just been wasting our time.)</p>
<h3 id="c13">BABY TALK</h3>
<p>Some people seem to think that milk
is for babies only. You might just as
well say that baths are for babies only.
Or love, or petting. No one ever outgrows
the need for milk (or baths or
love or petting). No other food will
do as much to maintain health throughout
life.</p>

<h3 id="c15">CONCERNING CALORIES</h3>
<p>You probably know about calories.
There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about them.
In case, however, you still confuse them
with vitamins, we point out that a calorie
is simply a rather nice word for a measurement
of energy. If you weigh too much,
you aren&rsquo;t using up calories as fast as you
are taking them in.</p>
<p>In case you have vowed to carry this
booklet around with you until you have
lost such and such a number of pounds&mdash;and
it might be a good idea&mdash;we have
gone to considerable pains to make lists
of foods with the number of calories in
each. We have not counted these calories
personally, but somebody with better
eyes than ours has, and you may rely on
his count. (See pages <a href="#Page_30">30</a> to 35.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h3 id="c16">WORDS TO LADIES OF WILL POWER</h3>
<p>If you need to reduce, take your excess
weight off gradually (no more than 1 to
2 pounds weekly) by cutting your calories
every day. Try eating 500 to 1,000 calories
less daily until you discover what
it takes to lose the desired amount. Pick
your calories to reduce your weight, not
your disposition.</p>
<p>When you reach the weight at which
you <i>feel</i> best and <i>look</i> best, don&rsquo;t get
wobbly in will power or careless in eating.</p>
<p>This may take some figuring, but remember,
this booklet is all about figures anyhow.</p>
<p>THANK YOU for going all this way
with us. We hope that you&rsquo;ll find it was
well worth the time. If we ever meet you
face to face we&rsquo;ll probably exclaim, &ldquo;Darling,
how WELL you look! Haven&rsquo;t you
lost some weight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h3 id="c17">UP THE SCALE</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="300" height="223" />
</div>
<p>The next few
pages are written
on an ascending scale for
those who want to go up, up,
UP to Par:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Par in vitality</p>
<p class="t0">Par in energy</p>
<p class="t0">Par in good looks</p>
</div>
<p>We spoke pretty sternly to a certain
Mrs. Plenteous. Now let us give thought
to Mrs. Plenteous&rsquo; sister-under-the-skin-and-bones,
Miss Gaunt.</p>
<p>For months Miss Gaunt&rsquo;s overstuffed
friends may have fawned on her figure:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so <i>slender</i>, my dear!&rdquo; Now
&ldquo;slender&rdquo; is indeed a flattering word.
But any good dictionary will list some
sinister synonyms: spare, lank, skinny,
scrawny, scraggly, and spindly, to name
a few. Some day the remark will be:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so skin&mdash;er&mdash;slender, my dear!&rdquo;&mdash;and
Miss Gaunt will feel flattened&mdash;not
flattered.</p>
<p>And perhaps she&rsquo;ll take a good long
look at herself, noting certain hollows in
the cheek, certain knobs in the elbows,
a certain chronic weariness, (not to mention
crossness) and she&rsquo;ll think: &ldquo;Maybe
I <i>should</i> try to build up a little.&rdquo; When
that time comes, we do hope that Mrs.
Plenteous lends her this booklet.</p>
<h3 id="c18">FIGURE IT OUT</h3>
<p>Many over or underweight people love
to blame their figures on their ancestors.
(If they&rsquo;re perfect 36&rsquo;s, of course, they
take all the credit themselves.) &ldquo;My
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
dear grandmother weighed 200 pounds,
so there&rsquo;s not a thing I can do about it,&rdquo;
beams Mrs. Plenteous, splashing the third
lump of sugar in her coffee. &ldquo;<i>My</i> family
tree was a beanpole,&rdquo; sighs Miss Gaunt.
&ldquo;No thanks&mdash;no sugar or cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth is that, according to anthropologists,
there are in general three types
of body build: the stout, the medium,
and the lean. You may possibly have
inherited your grandmother&rsquo;s type of
figure, just as you may also have inherited
her house. But there&rsquo;s no law against remodeling
the house&mdash;or the figure. Surely
the smart thing is to
make the house the best
possible house of its
type, one which you&rsquo;ll
enjoy living in; and the
figure the best possible
figure of <i>its</i> type&mdash;one
you&rsquo;ll enjoy living <i>with</i>.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="68" height="149" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3 id="c19">IT SHOULD BE DONE</h3>
<p>Perhaps we&rsquo;ve dwelt overmuch on the
good looks angle. But surely the right
angle on good looks is good health. To
be under par is to be caught short on
the reserves which, if you have them,
do so much to cushion the bumps of hectic
modern living, and ward off the illnesses
that pounce so gleefully on the tired,
the rundown, the undernourished human
frame.</p>
<h3 id="c20">IT CAN BE DONE</h3>
<p>A wise nutritionist has said, &ldquo;There
are two ways of building up, just as there
are two ways of getting rich. One is to
cut down on your expenses, the other is
to increase your income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; are energy, and you
can decrease them by taking more rest,
less violent exercise, more sleep, and by
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
keeping calm. The &ldquo;income&rdquo; is food. And
the thing to do with it is to eat <i>more</i> of it&mdash;and
<i>more choosily</i> of it! For though
music may be the food of love, the food
of growth is groceries!</p>
<p>Too often have we heard languid creatures
wail, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not hungry&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
swallow a <i>thing</i>!&rdquo; To them from us goes
a simple but hearty &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="152" height="150" />
</div>
<p>Swallowing is an ordinary mechanical
act which almost anybody can perform,
providing there is no foreign body in the
throat (in which case hang by your heels
or call your doctor). The hitch is that
most people who claim that
they can&rsquo;t eat are waiting for
appetite to say when. Now your
appetite is a fickle
counselor and often
does not have
your best interest
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
at heart. Just look what it does to Mrs.
Plenteous! Our advice is this: Ignore it
and eat anyhow. Chances are that appetite,
surprised and stimulated by regular
shipments of body-building food, will
come to life and get back on the job.</p>
<p>Other non-eaters insist that their
stomachs are too small. Well, stomachs
are timid creatures. If they don&rsquo;t get
much they quit expecting much. And they
shrink. But they are flexible organs and
adapt well to inflation. Start feeding them
more, and they&rsquo;ll take it&mdash;and like it.
Start gradually, though, and give them
time to adjust. Eat oftener and less at a
time. And at regular times! Increase your
calories by 500 to 1,000 a day (see pages
<a href="#Page_30">30</a> to 35). But don&rsquo;t just pile them on.
Team them up with their right partners&mdash;the
PROTEINS, VITAMINS, MINERALS.
And of course don&rsquo;t take our
word for <i>anything</i> without checking with
your doctor!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h3 id="c21">MRS. PLENTEOUS SHOULDN&rsquo;T PEEK</h3>
<p>The next few pages may be a little hard
on Mrs. Plenteous, so we hope she left us
on <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>. For from here on in we get
just voracious about food. &ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo;
Miss Gaunt&mdash;</p>
<p>NOT to a cup of bouillon&mdash;BUT to a
brimming bowl of cream soup</p>
<p>NOT to lettuce leaves and lemon juice&mdash;BUT
to a salad bowl, tangy with

Mrs. P. and Miss G. can sip with sociability.
For milk is the menu&rsquo;s best builder-upper
and is essential whether you&rsquo;re
headed UP or DOWN. But while Mrs.
Plenteous should stick to plain, whole
milk, (with such companions as cottage
cheese, American cheese, plain ice cream,
and some butter) Miss Gaunt may let
herself go on parts of milk that will stick
to <i>her</i>&mdash;cream, butter, and cream cheeses.</p>
<p>Milk has many virtues: It adds to the
food income without cramming bulk into
those small stomachs previously noted.
And it is the world&rsquo;s best mixer, combining
graciously with hundreds of other
foods, enhancing and enriching them.</p>
<p>Consider a few of the forms milk can
assume. Every one is a boost for Miss
Gaunt as she goes up, up, UP that scale:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">cereals cooked with milk</p>
<p class="t0">eggs poached in milk</p>
<p class="t0">vegetables anointed with butter</p>
<p class="t0">cheese souffles</p>
<p class="t0">potatoes, scalloped, mashed, or creamed</p>
<p class="t0">custards and custard sauces</p>
<p class="t0">oyster stew&mdash;half and half</p>
<p class="t0">cakes, cookies, tarts&mdash;with ice cream</p>
<p class="t0">strawberries, peaches and cream</p>
<p class="t0">cantaloupe <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, pie <i>&agrave; la mode</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>Indeed, anything <i>&agrave; la mode</i> is the right
mode for Miss Gaunt!</p>
<p>Whee! Merely setting down such a list
makes us feel as though we&rsquo;d put on ten
pounds. Pardon us while we unhook our
stays!</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="164" height="150" />
</div>
<p>And may you,
Miss Gaunt, soon
be doing the same!
BUT&mdash;don&rsquo;t overdo
it! Mrs. Plenteous
knows it is
hard to <i>melt</i>. Set
your goals to look
and feel your best.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
